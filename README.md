# BuildingEscapeProject

Following Unreal guides + instruction videos.
Made using Unreal Engine (C++/C#)


Progress Update: 
There is a problem revolving around linking errors 2001 and 2019 when launching within Unreal Engine. Compiles, builds and launches outside of Unreal.
Solution: Contacted Unreal community. No response. Testing shows it's an incorrect provisional directory. Other errors are fixed.
